<h1>Zombie Run</h1>

<p>This is my final project for CPSC 4970. It simulates a two-dimensional game 
of the user running through a zombie apocalypse.</p>

<h2>Game Play</h2>

<p>1. To play the game, import the following code in the terminal:</p>
<ol>
    <pre><code>pip install pygame</code></pre>
</ol>

<p>2. Navigate to the main.py and run the code. The main menu for the game will appear.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>As a coding instructor, I have helped create pygames for students. 
One example of a game created is Dimno that required the player to
have enemies/obstacles, take damage, and/or win the game. Dimno required similar 
game instructions as my final project, Zombie Run.</p>
